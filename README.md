# Delta overlay for Retroarch
# Introduction
The goal of this project is to recreate Delta overlays as closely as possible, given the limitations of the Android version of Retroarch.
What makes this project different from other Delta Projects? That I am trying to recreate the Delta Skins with Retroarch adjustments. Replacing
features that are impossible to implement without making a custom version of Retroarch. Another thing that makes this project different
from other projects is that this one has multiple overlays in one folder, an Input overlay in landscape as well as portrait mode, a blank 
overlay for playing with a controller, and an overhauled menu to fit with the Delta aesthetic.
